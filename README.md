Benefits of Using Webpack
Customizable Module Resolution:

Webpack's resolve configuration allows you to define how modules are found and resolved.
You can specify directories to search for modules, file extensions to resolve, and aliases for path simplification.
Transpilation Support:

With ts-loader, Webpack can transpile your TypeScript code into JavaScript, handling any necessary transformations.
Bundling and Optimization:

Webpack can bundle your application into a single file or split it into chunks, optimizing for performance.
Compatibility with Modern Dependencies:

Webpack handles both ES Modules and CommonJS modules, allowing you to use the latest versions of dependencies like unified and remark-parse.
Avoiding File Extensions in Imports:

By configuring the extensions option, you can import modules without specifying file extensions.
